### Z5D accuracy, scaling, and performance

* **RSA Tuning Scaling Experiment** — Documents why RSA-100 works but scaling to RSA-129 fails; proposes adaptive c(n) and logarithmic search. See [docs/rsa_tuning_scaling_experiment.md](docs/rsa_tuning_scaling_experiment.md).
* **Balanced Semiprime Factorization Validation** — Achieves 100% success on N<10,000 with ε=1.0 tuned bands, validating Z5D heuristics for small-modulus RSA grids. [PR #XXX]
